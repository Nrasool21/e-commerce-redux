## Description 

We were asked to to refactor the e-commerce platform using Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API through Redux library. 

import { createStore } from 'redux'

The above is a reducer function that takes a current state value and an action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
We replaced use reducer with redux.
